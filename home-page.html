     <h2>Child Abuse</h2>
     <p>Child abuse involves the physical, emotional, or sexual mistreatment or neglect 
        of a minor, resulting in potential harm to their well-being and development. It 
        can take various forms, including physical violence, verbal aggression, or failure 
        to provide necessary care. Addressing child abuse requires a comprehensive 
        approach involving education, awareness, and appropriate legal measures to
         ensure the safety and protection of children..</p>
     <h2>Animal abuse</h2>
     <p>Animal abuse is a heinous act that entails causing harm or inflicting pain on an 
        animal. It often involves intentionally harming or killing animals for entertainment 
        or pleasure. Animals that are victims of animal abuse suffer greatly and have a lifelong
         impact. It is against the law to abuse animals, and those who engage in animal abuse should
          be held accountable.</p>
     <h2>Emotinal abuse</h2>
     <p>Emotional abuse is a type of abuse in which a person is consistently mistreated, manipulated,
         or degraded over time. This type of abuse occurs through the use of words, body language, or 
         other non-physical means to cause mental, emotional, or psychological harm. In many cases, 
         emotional abuse can be difficult to recognize and can have long-term impacts on the victim's 
         mental health, relationships, and self-esteem. If you or someone you know is experiencing 
         emotional abuse, it's important to seek help and support.</p>
